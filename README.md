# Unity Grappling Hook

---

## About

Grappling hook project used during the second unity lecture in the Simulation and simulation languages course at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences (A mandatory 4th year course for the students taking the information systems and technologies module). The point of the project is teaching students how to approach **implementing game mechanics in a 3D environment** and also getting the students more comfortable with **Unity's physics system**.

## What I've Done

* Planned the content of the lecture
* Made the project using free assets for the visuals and **my own logic** for the character movement and grappling hook (custom C# scripts).
* Held a lecture at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences using the project walking students through the implementation of a grappling hook mechanic
* You can find an online version of the lecture in serbian here: **NOTE: It's only available in serbian.**
